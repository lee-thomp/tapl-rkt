** Summary

These are a collection of my solutions and workings out of various exercises from Benjamin Pierce's [[https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/][Types and Programming Languages]] implemented in Racket. Each exercise or section I wrote code for should have its own directory containing the solution/work along with an individual readme and some tests.


** Running

For these exercises I use Emacs' [[https://www.nongnu.org/geiser/][Geiser]] mode, but loading files of interest into a bare REPL should work as well. Tests for any exercise can be run using =racket -t run-tests.rkt=.
